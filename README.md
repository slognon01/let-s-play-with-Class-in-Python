Build A Pokemon Game
I used Object-Oriented Programming to model game entities and allow them to interact with each other. This is tiny implementation of a Pokemon-like game that allows me to create little creatures, feed them to gain health, and let them battle against each other.

Key Concepts
1. Object-Oriented Programming in Python
2. Game logic
3. Instance methods
4. @staticmethod
5. Dunder methods: __init__, __str__
6. if __name__ == '__main__'
